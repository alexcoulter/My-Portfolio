        <p>My name is James Alexander Coulter but I go by Alex.  I was born and raised in Durham, North Carolina and went
        to school down the road at UNC Chapel Hill.  I've been interested in coding since I was in 9th grade and got my first graphing calculator for Geometry class. I found myself making simple programs with loops and user commands.
        Since then, I've taken a few formal courses on HTML and Javascript, but I've mostly found free resources online to
        learn from.  That is until now.  I am currently enrolled in a  6 month coding bootcamp through UNC Chapel Hill and am excited to further my education and hone my skillset.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I've been playin soccer since I was four years old and presenty play in an over 30 soccer league
        in Chapel Hill.  I also enjoy playing disc golf with friends, going to the gym, and playing the guitar.  I am 
        currently bartending in downtown Durham but am hoping to transition soon into a career involving application and web development.  I think that my hard-working nature and analytical skills will lead me to become a very competitive job candidate once I have expanded on my portfolio.
